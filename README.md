# MISC

This contains utility programs to help me.

## Structure

Each folder contains a specific application. I have chosen to not use a golang workspace
because I want to use this as an opportunity to learn an alternative (maybe using Bazel will help).

No module containing a `main` function will be prifixed by this repository URL.
